    <h2>About Skill Wave</h2>
    <p>
        Skill Wave is a personal project I developed as part of my web development portfolio.
        It is a fully functional learning platform built to demonstrate my skills in both frontend and backend development.
    </p>
    <p>
        The platform allows users to browse courses by categories, view course details, and manage content dynamically.
        It was created using Angular for the frontend and a custom-built backend API.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was developed to enhance my expertise in full-stack development and responsive web design.
        All content and courses presented on this platform are for demonstration purposes only.
